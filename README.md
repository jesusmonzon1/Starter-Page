# Starter-Page
#### Background
Inspired by the community at [R/Starterpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) I decided to build my own version with things I would find useful. Other than the typical bookmarks I use I also wanted to know the current weather and current bitcoin price. Using openweatherapi and alphaadvantage, respectively for this data. This was a great project in my JavaScript journey as I learned how to consume API data, loop over an array of bookmarks and also how to use the switch/case system for my search engine selection.
#### How to use
For your own use please provide your API keys in the file api.js and your own bookmarks in file app.js. Currently the bitcoin markup is commented out because of my personal preference.
